CAPSTONE REQUIREMENTS AND DEADLINES

### REQUIREMENTS
##### Technical Requirements:
* React
* CRUD using JS Fetch API
* Minimal Styling (Your app should be visually appealing to the eye and have a logical, simple interface for the user. Styling should be your last priority and worked on only when your mentor approves.)
* It is NOT required to use an external API.

##### Planning:
* Once ERD is approved, write issue tickets in Github
* Create wireframes (use whatever tool you want - moqups, lucid charts, photoshop, adobe XD, Figma, etc.)
* If you are using an external API, gather all sample data and be prepared to demo your api at your first checkin (via Postman) before committing to use the API.
* Make sure you have a project board set up in github and migrate your issue tickets.
* If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your capstone mentor will not let you code.

##### Project NoNos:
* Projects shouldn't be something for your day job
* Projects shouldn't be for someone who will pay you :moneybag:.
* No MVP can include a calendar
* No apps that require use of the spotify API.
* No games
* No game tracking applications - ie dashboards for DnD, WoW, etc
