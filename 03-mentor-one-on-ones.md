# Mentor 1:1's
### Requirements for your one on one
* Purpose: to outline and agree on your capstone MVP.
* In preparation for this meeting, make sure your capstone proposal document is complete. It should include:
> 1. A list of features for MVP
> 1. A list of stretch goals
> 1. Completed wireframes
> 1. Well written BDD Issues tickets. **No one should be coding at this point, therefore your repo should be empty!!!** Remember, you can create an empty repo and still use the `Issues` and `Projects` tab.
> 1. Completed Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
> 1. A working API get request. If you plan to use another API you need to demonstrate the ability to connect to this API and return data back. Be prepared to show the data you are getting back from your API in Postman. If you are using any packages, tools, etc. that were not covered in class, be prepared to demo that you have went through the documentation and tested out a basic implementation. This can be a simple HTML/JS app. NO EXTENSIONS in time will be granted for this. If you do not have a working API call on this date then use of your API will be a stretch goal and not part of your MVP. Same for all external libraries and tools.
* At the end of this meeting you should have:
> 1. A list of your MVP goals
> 1. An ordered list of your stretch goals
