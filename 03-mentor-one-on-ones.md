# Mentor 1:1's

### Check in #1: Monday/Tuesday 12/07/2020 & 12/08/2020
* This is your first check in
* Purpose: to outline and agree on your capstone MVP.
* Preparation for this meeting:
> 1. Completed wireframes
> 1. A github project with your application planned out - cards written by feature, lots of detail in each card
> 1. Completed Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
> 1. A working API get request.  If you plan to use another API you need to demonstrate the ability to connect to this API and return data back. Be prepared to show the data you are getting back from your API in Postman. NO EXTENSIONS in time will be granted for this.  If you do not have a working API call on this date then use of your API will be a stretch goal and not part of your MVP.
* At the end of this meeting you should have:
> 1. A list of your MVP goals
> 1. An ordered list of your stretch goals
